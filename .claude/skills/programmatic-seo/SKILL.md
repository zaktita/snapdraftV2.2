# SEO: Programmatic SEO

Guides programmatic SEO—creating large numbers of SEO-optimized pages automatically using templates and structured data, rather than writing each page manually. **Classic “mail merge” pSEO** (one rigid template + swapped variables) often produced **low differentiation** and thin-feeling URLs. **With AI used responsibly on top of the same data spine**, you can scale **per-URL customization**—intent-aligned copy, section depth, FAQs, tone, localization—while still following **evidence blocks**, **data tiers**, and **QA** (see **Data strength hierarchy** and **AI-assisted generation** below).

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

**Project context**: If `.claude/project-context.md` or `.cursor/project-context.md` exists, read product/ICP sections before proposing playbooks or page types.

## Definition

**Programmatic SEO** = Building a single template and populating it with data from a database, API, or spreadsheet to generate hundreds or thousands of unique pages. Each page targets a long-tail keyword (e.g., "best SEO tool in [city]," "[App A] + [App B] integration").

**Key differences from traditional SEO**: Technical (SEOs + engineers); long-tail focus; data-driven (data quality = success); automation; built for scale.

## Classic limits vs AI-enhanced differentiation

| Era | What breaks | What helps |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| **Rigid pSEO** | One template, minimal variance → similar titles/bodies, weak **E-E-A-T**, “obvious mail merge” | Still needs **unique evidence per URL** and selective indexation |
| **AI-enhanced pSEO** | Same **structured rows** (facts, SKUs, metrics) drive the page, but models add **per-URL narrative**: intros, FAQ depth, persona angles, localization, internal-link suggestions—**higher differentiation** at scale | **Facts stay in your data layer**; AI shapes **phrasing and structure**, not invented numbers—see **AI-assisted generation** |

**Best-practice stance**: AI is an **accelerator and customizer**, not a substitute for **data defensibility** (Tiers 1–5) or **technical SEO** (URLs, schema, CWV). Used well, it aligns with **quality over quantity**: fewer thin URLs, more **distinct** useful pages.

## Three-Part Framework

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Templates** | Reusable page structures: layout, headings, internal links, content blocks; conditional logic for empty fields |
| **Data** | Structured information: locations, products, prices, features—must be accurate, complete, and add genuine value |
| **Automation** | Systems connecting data to templates; pages generated dynamically or published in bulk |
| **AI layer (optional)** | On **grounded inputs** (row JSON + rules), generates **varied copy**, FAQ expansions, and section emphasis **per URL**—reduces “same template” fatigue while staying auditable |

## Page Playbook Matrix (`skills/pages`)

Page types in this library live under `pages/{brand|content|legal|marketing|utility}/`. Use the matrix below to map **search pattern → playbook → which `*-page-generator` skill** to open for structure, copy, and schema—not every folder is a good fit for mass-generated URLs.

| Playbook | Example intent / keyword pattern | Page skill (`name`) | Path (reference) |
|----------|----------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Alternatives / comparisons** | "[Competitor] alternatives", "X vs Y" | alternatives-page-generator | `pages/marketing/alternatives` |
| **Integrations** | "[Product A] [Product B] integration" | integrations-page-generator | `pages/marketing/integrations` |
| **Category / catalog** | Faceted listings, product grids | category-page-generator, products-page-generator | `pages/marketing/category-pages`, `products` |
| **Glossary / definitions** | "what is [term]", term landings | glossary-page-generator | `pages/content/glossary` |
| **FAQ / Q&A** | Question banks, PAA-style pages | faq-page-generator | `pages/content/faq` |
| **How-to / procedures** | Step libraries, "[how to] [task]" blocks in templates | howto-section-generator | `components/content/howto-section` |
| **Comparison matrix (blocks)** | Feature/criteria grids, "vs" cells from data feed | comparison-table-generator | `components/content/comparison-table` |
| **Tools & lead magnets** | "free [x] tool/calculator" | tools-page-generator | `pages/content/tools` |
| **Template gallery** | Browse → detail (your templates) | template-page-generator | `pages/content/template-page` |
| **Resource hub** | Guides, hubs, download centers | resources-page-generator | `pages/content/resources` |
| **Use cases / solutions** | "for [role]", "by industry" | use-cases-page-generator, solutions-page-generator | `pages/marketing/use-cases`, `solutions` |
| **Migration / switching** | "migrate from [X]" | migration-page-generator | `pages/marketing/migration` |
| **Campaign landing** | Paid/segment LPs | landing-page-generator | `pages/marketing/landing-page` |
| **Blog / article** | Long-tail articles at scale | blog-page-generator, article-page-generator | `pages/content/blog`, `article` |
| **Docs / features / API** | Scalable doc sections, feature landings, `/api` marketing | docs-page-generator, features-page-generator, api-page-generator | `pages/content/docs`, `features`, `api` |
| **Social proof** | Logos, case studies, galleries | press-coverage-page-generator, customer-stories-page-generator, showcase-page-generator | `pages/marketing/press-coverage`, `customer-stories`, `showcase` |
| **Programs & offers** | Startups/education, contests, downloads, affiliate, media kit | startups-page-generator, contest-page-generator, download-page-generator, affiliate-page-generator, media-kit-page-generator | `pages/marketing/*` |
| **Pricing / services** | Plans, offerings (use sparingly for pSEO) | pricing-page-generator, services-page-generator | `pages/marketing/pricing`, `services` |

**Usually not mass programmatic** (single primary URL or compliance-heavy): `pages/brand/*` (home, about, contact), `pages/legal/*`, most `pages/utility/*` (404, status, signup-login, etc.)—treat as one-off or policy-driven, not template×data scale.

## Template Structure (Recommended)

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Intro** | Introduction; matches user intent |
| **Evidence block** | Data-driven content unique to each page (tables, lists, verified stats); differentiates from thin content |
| **Decision** | Comparison, recommendation, or next steps |
| **FAQ** | Frequently asked questions |
| **CTA** | Call-to-action |

**Evidence block** = Real, structured data per page (business listings, pricing, reviews, verified stats). Ensures each page delivers genuine value, not recycled boilerplate with swapped variables.

## Data strength hierarchy (defensibility)

**Strongest programmatic pages are fueled by what only your product (or your customers inside your product) can produce**—especially **templates, exports, and generated artifacts**. Third-party or scraped lists alone are the weakest foundation.

| Tier | Source | Examples | Relative risk |
|------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **1 — Product-generated** | Assets created or rendered by your product: page/layout **templates**, email/Notion/code templates, export packs, generated previews, branded snippets, “built with [Product]” examples | Template gallery rows tied to real `.json` / CMS fields; screenshots of exports; unique preview URLs | **Lowest** when each URL shows distinct generated output |
| **2 — Product-derived** | Telemetry and in-product data you own: aggregates, cohorts, benchmarks, feature adoption | “Teams in [industry] median time-to-value” from your warehouse (aggregated) | Low if aggregated / anonymized and policy-compliant |
| **3 — UGC / customer** | Reviews, submissions, showcase items, moderated community content | Showcase grid; verified quotes | Medium—needs moderation + consent |
| **4 — Licensed / partner** | Exclusive feeds, co-marketing datasets | Partner pricing tiers; licensed industry stats | Medium—contract and citation discipline |
| **5 — Public / scraped** | Open web, directories, generic enrichment | Name/address fills; commodity facts | **Highest**—needs editorial layer, fact-checking, and a real **Evidence block** |

**Why Tier 1 (templates & generated content) wins**: Pages built from **your** template system carry proprietary structure, variables, and brand-safe blocks—harder for competitors to copy verbatim and easier to prove uniqueness (embeds, downloads, IDs). Pair with **template-page-generator** when the UX is “browse gallery → use template.”

### Tier 2 — Product-derived (practical)

| What it is | What to watch |
|------------|----------------|
| Metrics from **your** backend, data warehouse, or support/CRM exports: activation rates by segment, integration popularity, error budgets, time-to-value—not generic “industry reports.” | **Privacy & ToS**: Minimum cell sizes; no individual identification; document what was aggregated and over what window. |
| Good fit when you can show **“only we could know this because it runs in our product.”** | **Stale data** hurts trust: pipeline jobs, “as of [date]” labels, automated invalidation. |

**AI here**: Use models to **turn structured aggregates into prose** (intro paragraphs, “what this means for [segment]”)—**input must be verified numbers/tables from your pipeline**, not free-form invention. Keep a **machine-readable table or JSON** on-page or in appendix so claims stay auditable.

### Tier 3 — UGC / customer (practical)

| What it is | What to watch |
|------------|----------------|
| Quotes, reviews, showcase submissions, community templates—**per-user artifacts** with consent. | **Moderation**: spam, PII, competitor attacks; **consent** for name/logo use; **schema** (Review, CreativeWork) only when accurate. |
| Strong when combined with **Tier 1** (e.g. “customer-built template” gallery). | **Volume without quality** → thin pages; cap or score submissions. |

**AI here**: Summarize long reviews into bullets; **generate draft alt text** for images; **cluster** submissions into topic pages—always **human approve** before publish. Do not fabricate testimonials.

### Tier 4 — Licensed / partner (practical)

| What it is | What to watch |
|------------|----------------|
| Partner price lists, co-marketed reports, API-fed **allowed** fields (logos, SKUs). | **Contract scope**: Which fields can appear on which URLs; attribution line; **DMCA / trademark** on logos. |
| Often **one feed → many URLs**; uniqueness must come from **your framing**, comparison logic, or calculator—not the raw feed alone. | **Refresh cadence** tied to partner SLAs. |

**AI here**: Draft **comparison copy** and **FAQs** from a **fixed attribute table** (license + partner rules); never invent SKUs or prices—**pull from feed**, let AI phrase and shorten.

### Tier 5 — Public / scraped (practical)

| What it is | What to watch |
|------------|----------------|
| Open data, directories, Wikipedia-style facts, **enrichment** of public entities. | **Highest** duplicate/thin risk: everyone has the same facts; **you must add** synthesis, editorial angle, or a **unique tool** (calculator, filter) on top. |
| **Entity SEO** and **citations** matter: link to authoritative sources; date-stamp volatile facts. | Plan for **pruning** or **noindex** on low-traffic thin URLs. |

**AI here**: Use models to **structure** messy public text into tables, **outline** sections, **suggest** internal links—then **fact-check** names, numbers, and dates. **Do not** use AI to invent statistics or citations; treat output as **draft** until verified.

### AI-assisted generation (cross-tier)

**Why AI fits modern pSEO**: Early programmatic SEO earned a bad reputation because **templates were frozen** and **copy was interchangeable**—little real differentiation per query. **LLMs**, when **grounded** on each row’s facts and your brand rules, make it practical to **customize** headlines, intros, FAQs, and “why this page matters” **per URL** without hand-writing thousands of pages. That moves execution closer to **best practices** (intent match, helpful content, unique value) **at scale**, provided you **do not** let the model invent data.

| Principle | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| **Ground AI in structured inputs** | Pass JSON/CSV rows (tier, source URL, metrics) into prompts; **forbid** hallucinated numbers in system prompts. |
| **Separate “facts” from “phrasing”** | Data layer = source of truth; AI = tone, shortening, localization, FAQs, **per-segment emphasis**—never the other way around. |
| **Vary structure, not only adjectives** | Ask for different **section order**, FAQ count, or “beginner vs power user” angles **by intent flags** in the row—reduces template sameness. |
| **Human or automated QA** | Spot-check high-traffic URLs; block publish if required fields empty or citation missing. |
| **Disclose when useful** | e.g. “Intro generated with AI; figures from [internal report, Q3 2025].” Builds trust and matches policy trends. |

**When AI generation is a strong lever**: Tiers **2–5**—where raw material is already tabular or repetitive but **needs readable, differentiated copy at scale**. Tier **1** still benefits from AI (drafts from export JSON), but the **differentiator remains** the product artifact itself.

### Operational requirements (all tiers)

| Requirement | Practice |
|-------------|----------|
| **Provenance** | Log data sources; track origin per field |
| **Freshness rules** | e.g., ratings every 90 days, prices every 30 days, template version bumps when layouts change |
| **Prefer 1–2 over 5** | Fill evidence with product-generated or product-derived data before reaching for public scraping |
| **AI governance** | Structured inputs only; no unverified numbers; moderation on UGC; optional disclosure |
| **Clean & merge** | Deduplicate keys; drop rows that produce duplicate intents |

## Ideal Use Cases

For **which page-generator skill to use**, see **Page Playbook Matrix** above. Generic patterns:

| Use case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Location-specific pages** | "Plumber in [city]," "Best restaurants in [neighborhood]" with real local data |
| **Product comparison** | "[Product A] vs [Product B]" with structured specs |
| **Alternatives pages** | "[Competitor] alternatives" at scale; 50+ competitors; see **alternatives-page-generator** |
| **Software integration** | "[App A] + [App B]" integration pages (e.g., Zapier 50K+ pages) |
| **Free tools** | "[X] checker," "[Y] calculator," "[Z] generator" — standalone tool pages; toolkit hub; same ICP as main product; lead gen |
| **Travel / destination** | City + attraction combinations with reviews, photos |
| **E-commerce** | Category pages, product variations (size, color, material) |
| **FAQ / Q&A** | Pages powered by user question databases |
| **Salary / pricing** | Comparison pages with structured data |

**Avoid when**: Site structure is weak; page differences are superficial (city/name swaps only); content requires original expertise or UGC participation.

## Real-World Examples

*Examples are illustrative; no endorsement implied.*

| Company | Scale | Pattern |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Zapier** | 50,000+ pages | "[App A] + [App B]" integration |
| **Airbnb** | — | Location search; destination × property |
| **Review platforms** | — | User reviews + automated comparison pages |
| **Travel sites** | — | Destination, hotel, flight, activity pages |
| **NomadList** | 2,000+ city pages | Cost-of-living, internet speed (dynamic data) |
| **Semrush, Ahrefs** | 50+ free tools | SEO checker, keyword tool, backlink checker; toolkit hub + per-tool pages |

## Content Requirements

| Requirement | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **300+ words per page** | Avoid thin content penalties |
| **Unique, verifiable data** | Each page must add meaningful page-specific content beyond simple data swaps |
| **Evidence block** | Tables, lists, examples with real numbers/attributes on every page |
| **Semantic HTML** | Proper structure; conditional logic to avoid empty or repetitive sections |
| **Internal linking** | Link related programmatic pages; compounds traffic and indexation |

## Technical Considerations

| Topic | Practice |
|-------|----------|
| **Subfolder vs subdomain** | Prefer **subfolders** (`yoursite.com/integration/slack-notion/`) over **subdomains** (`integrations.yoursite.com/...`) so authority consolidates on the primary domain; see **url-structure**, **domain-architecture** if restructuring |
| **Selective indexation** | Don't index all pages; use noindex rules for low-value pages |
| **Sitemap segmentation** | By country, language, division; manage crawl budget |
| **URL structure** | Descriptive URLs; clean hierarchy; see **url-structure** |
| **Schema** | JSON-LD: Product, Place, FAQ, ItemList per page type |
| **Performance** | Caching, static generation; Core Web Vitals |

## Critical Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Thin content** | Minimal info beyond keyword; generic copy; placeholder sections → penalties |
| **Duplicate pages** | Same content with only data swaps → thin content penalties |
| **Index bloat** | Generating pages that should never be indexable → crawl budget waste |
| **Large dumps** | Publishing many similar pages at once → spam signals |
| **Filter URLs** | Using filters instead of unique URLs/titles → cannibalization |

Pages with only a title, one paragraph, and swapped city names will not rank and may incur Google penalties.

## Remediating Already-Built Homogenized Pages

If programmatic pages are already published and feel interchangeable — shared closing sentences, identical value propositions across URLs, cloned section endings — fix the content before it triggers quality signals.

### Diagnostic approach

Run regex scans across rendered or source files to surface shared sentence tails and repeated paragraph structures. Look for patterns that appear in more than 30% of same-category pages. Common telltales: every tool page ending with "X is the ideal choice for Y," every category page sharing the same technology summary, every location page using identical FAQ tails.

Scan at three scopes: within a single page (do its sections repeat the same closing formula?), within a category (do all video tool pages share a template?), and across categories (is the same value statement on every page site-wide?).

### Prioritize fixes into three levels

| Priority | What it is | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **P0 — Eliminate** | Pure template filler with no information value; every page says the same thing | Rewrite each page independently with page-specific detail |
| **P1 — Rewrite** | Core information is correct but delivery is formulaic (e.g., "different tools use different architectures" — true but generic) | Prepare 8–15 semantic variants and cycle through them so adjacent pages differ |
| **P2 — Reduce density** | Normal vocabulary that appears too frequently (e.g., "seamless" on 80% of pages) | Replace ~30–40% of instances, not all — normal words are fine at moderate frequency |

### Execute in rounds

Fix P0 patterns first, one category at a time. After each round, re-scan to confirm patterns are cleared and no new ones appeared. A common trap: replacing one template with another by applying the same fix uniformly. Distribute rewrites so pages processed in sequence get different treatments.

For single-page internal duplicates — where all use cases or tool descriptions within one file share identical closing sentences — use functional endings instead of evaluative ones. A functional ending describes what bottleneck the entry solves in practice; an evaluative ending just declares it's a good choice.

### Prevention in the pipeline

Add structural-variety requirements to AI generation prompts (vary section endings, forbid repeated closing formulas). Batch-generate pages from different categories together rather than all from one category at once. Run N-gram overlap checks across same-category pages before publishing.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Research** — Niche, intent; include low-volume keywords; SEO tools, question databases
2. **Collect data** — Provenance log, freshness rules; first-party/licensed; define template fields
3. **Choose stack** — Next.js + DB, Webflow CMS, WordPress, headless; API + template reuse
4. **Design template** — Intro, Evidence, Decision, FAQ, CTA; schema; conditional logic
5. **Build database** — Map fields to template slots; hide empties
6. **Generate pages** — Descriptive URLs; optimize performance
7. **Deploy & monitor** — Sitemaps; indexation, rankings, CTR, bounce, conversions
8. **Optimize** — Prune weak pages; refresh data; A/B test layout, CTA

## Best Practices

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Quality over scale** | Each page must provide genuinely unique, verifiable value |
| **Differentiation over clone** | Prefer **AI-grounded** copy variance + evidence blocks over one static paragraph with `{city}` swaps |
| **Launch in batches** | Small batches you can measure; avoid large dumps |
| **Strong IA** | Internal links to related guides/categories |
| **Visual elements** | Tables, maps, comparisons where relevant |
| **Match intent** | Avoid generic template text; precise user intent |
